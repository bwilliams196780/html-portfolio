    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, I'm Brian. I'm a 25-year-old insurance agent from Texas, redirecting my career to my true
        passion: software development. My goal is to build the kinds of video games I've always loved to play.
    </p>

    <p>
        I grew up in the hood, and for a long time, my world didn't extend much past my block. I knew I wanted more for
        myself than what comes with being a hood rat, a feeling that often made me an outsider or an 'oreo' to my peers.
        That drive for more is what fuels my journey into the tech world today.

        <li>
            <b>Focus on What Matters:</b> Inspired by <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i>, I concentrate my
            energy on impactful goals.
        </li>

            <b>Build for the Long Term:</b> From <i>A Simple Path to Wealth</i>, I learned the value of discipline and
            planning for the future.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Embrace the Grind:</b> My love for progression fantasies like <i>He Who Fights with Monsters</i>
            reflects my own drive for continuous self-improvement.
